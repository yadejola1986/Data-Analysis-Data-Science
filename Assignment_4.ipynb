It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format; You have x days, y weeks and z months left. Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers. Your output should match the words in the example output precisely. You should round the result to the nearest whole number.\n",

For small pizza, the fee is 15 dollars, for Medium Pizza, the fee is 20 dollars, for Large Pizza, the fee is 25 dollars, Pepperoni for small pizza, add extra 2 dollars, Pepperoni for medium or large pizza, add extra 3 dollars, and extra cheese for any size pizza, add extra 1 dollar.
